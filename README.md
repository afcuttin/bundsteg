Create and print pdf files with an inner margin (suitable for double sided printing).

# Rationale

If you wanna punch, clamp or stitch together a couple of sheets after printing them out then you need to leave out an inner margin which should remain unprinted in order to obtain a free space for the clamps to hold your pages together.
This script allows to obtain a printing gap whether you wanna print single or double sided, whether you wanna print in portrait or landscape orientation.
As the printing gap needs to stay on the inner side it alternates between the left or right for even and odd pages.
It is even possible to have a differently sized gap for even and odd pages.
